# **1. Regular Verbs (Verbi Regolari):**

- **What they are:** These verbs follow predictable conjugation patterns. Once you learn the pattern, you can apply it to many other verbs.
- **How to spot them:** They fall into three main groups based on their infinitive ending:
    - -are (e.g., _parlare_ - to speak)
    - -ere (e.g., _credere_ - to believe)
    - -ire (e.g., _dormire_ - to sleep)
- **Why they're important:** They form the backbone of Italian verb conjugation.

# **2. Irregular Verbs (Verbi Irregolari):**

- **What they are:** These verbs don't follow the regular conjugation patterns. They have unique changes in their stems or endings.
- **How to spot them:** You'll need to memorize their conjugations, as they don't follow a set rule.
- **Why they're important:** Many common and essential verbs are irregular (e.g., _essere_, _avere_, _andare_, _fare_).

# **3. Auxiliary Verbs (Verbi Ausiliari):**

- **What they are:** These verbs "help" other verbs to form compound tenses (past tenses, etc.) and the passive voice.
- **Main ones:** _Essere_ (to be) and _avere_ (to have).
- **Why they're important:** You can't form many Italian tenses without them.

# **4. Modal Verbs (Verbi Modali):**

- **What they are:** These verbs express possibility, necessity, desire, or ability.
- **Common ones:** _Potere_ (can/to be able to), _volere_ (to want), _dovere_ (must/to have to), _sapere_ (to know how to/can).
- **How they work:** They're followed by the infinitive of another verb.

# **5. Reflexive Verbs (Verbi Riflessivi):**

- **What they are:** These verbs indicate that the subject is performing an action on themselves.
- **How to spot them:** They're usually accompanied by a reflexive pronoun (e.g., _mi_, _ti_, _si_, _ci_, _vi_, _si_).
- **Example:** _Lavarsi_ (to wash oneself). _Mi lavo_ (I wash myself).

# **6. Transitive Verbs (Verbi Transitivi):**

- **What they are:** These verbs take a direct object (something or someone that receives the action).
- **Example:** _Mangiare la mela_ (to eat the apple). _La mela_ is the direct object.

# **7. Intransitive Verbs (Verbi Intransitivi):**

- **What they are:** These verbs don't take a direct object.
- **Example:** _Andare a casa_ (to go home). _A casa_ is a prepositional phrase, not a direct object.
