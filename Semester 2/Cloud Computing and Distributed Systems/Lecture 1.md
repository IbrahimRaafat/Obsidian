# Distributed Systems:
- Networked connected computers
- Interconnected, no distance limit
- Significant role in everyday applications
- Properties: concurrency, independence and failures

## Concurrency
- Individual Tasks performed, resource sharing
- Concurrent execution
- More resources enhance capacity

## No Global Clock
- coordination through message exchange
- shared concept of time needed
- struggles with clock synchronization
- No Universal correct time
- Limitation due to message reliance

## Independent Failures
- Failures may isolate computers, but they continue operation
- Programs may not detect failures
- Unawareness of crashes by components

# Resources in Distributed Systems
### Hardware Resources:
- Storage: HD, SSD, Cloud etc.
- I/O Devices: Reduce redundancy, costs
### Software Resources:
- Files: Access regardless of location
- Databases: Real-time collaboration
- Data Objects: object oriented programming
### Media and Communication:
- Streaming Services: Video, audio

# Examples of distributed systems
### Networks enable everyday services
- Distributed technology crucial for modern computing
### Diverse Applications:
- Localized to global systems
- Data-Centric to processor-intensive
- Simple sensors to powerful elements

### Billions of web pages
### complex indexing and processing

### Google's sophisticated distributed systems:
- Global Data center network
- Optimized Distributed file system
- Structured storage for quick access
- Lock service for synchronization
- Programming model for parallel computations
