Examples: ● IoT ● Industry 4.0 ● Critical infrastructures ● Government services ● Financial services (e.g. Banks) ● ... Attacking information systems is more and more harmful! Why is Computer Security so relevant?What is Computer Security? The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) deﬁnes Computer Security as: “Measures and controls that ensure conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the information processed, stored (and communicated) by a computer” The so-called “CIA” triad: Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, Availability NOTE: information system assets including hardware, software, ﬁrmware are all involved. Reference: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/computer_security Conﬁdentiality Deﬁnition: 1. Data conﬁdentiality: conﬁdential information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals 2. Privacy: individuals control what information related to them may be collected and stored and by/to whom that information may be disclosed Examples: ● Sensitive data in a database ● On-line payments (e.g. by credit card) ● Personal privacy while browsing the Web Integrity Deﬁnition: 1. Data integrity: information and programs are changed only in a speciﬁed and authorized manner 2. System integrity: a system performs its intended function, free from unauthorized manipulation Examples: ● Bank accounts ● Bank transfers ● IoT device ﬁrmware should not be altered Availability Deﬁnition: ● Systems work promptly and services are not denied to authorized users Examples: ● Cloud services ● E-voting ● Electrical grids (Cyber-physical) ● Remote surgery (QoS) More properties: Authenticity Deﬁnition: 1. Identiﬁcation: The possibility of correctly identifying an entity 2. Message Authentication: Conﬁdence in the validity of a transmission, a message, or message originator Examples: ● User login ● ATM PINs ● Veriﬁed email messages (origin and destination) More properties: Accountability Deﬁnition: ● The possibility of tracing an event to a unique entity ⇒ allows for tracing a security breach to a responsible party Examples: ● Digital signature ● Activity logs ● Forensic analysis Impact (cf. FIPS 199) Low i. effectiveness of primary functions is noticeably reduced ii. minor damage to organizational assets iii. minor ﬁnancial loss iv. minor harm to individuals Medium i. effectiveness of primary functions is signiﬁcantly reduced ii. signiﬁcant damage to organizational assets iii. signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss iv. signiﬁcant harm to individuals High i. unable to perform one or more primary functions ii. major damage to organizational assets iii. major ﬁnancial loss iv. severe or catastrophic harm to individuals (e.g. loss of life) Examples Patient allergy information: Inaccurate information could result in severe harm or death to a patient, and expose the hospital to massive liability ⇒ high requirement of integrity University web site: Not a critical component of the university’s information system, but its unavailability would cause signiﬁcant troubles to students and professors ⇒ medium requirement of availability Terminology (1) System Resource (Asset): A major application, general support system, high impact program, physical plant, mission critical system, personnel, equipment, or a logically related group of systems Threat: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation Vulnerability: Weakness in an information system that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source Attack: malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information and/or system resources. An attack is a threat that is carried out, typically through a vulnerability Terminology (2) Adversary (threat agent): Who conducts harmful activities Countermeasure: A device or techniques that reduce the effectiveness of attacks Risk: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened based on impact and likelihood Security Policy: A set of criteria for the provision of security services: deﬁnes and constrains the activities of a data processing facility in order to maintain a condition of security for systems and data Classes of attacks Active attack: An attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation Passive attack: An attempt to learn information from the system that does not affect system resources Inside attack: Initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter Outside attack: Initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system Example 1: Interception ● Attacker gets unauthorized access to information ● Breaks data conﬁdentiality ● Passive attack ● Example: ○ S sends a credit card number to D “in the clear” ⇒ Threat consequence: Unauthorized disclosure Source Destination Attacker Example 2: Modiﬁcation ● Attacker maliciously modiﬁes information ● Breaks integrity and possibly authenticity, accountability. ● Active attack ● Example: ○ A redirects S bank transfer to herself ○ NOTE: A can be either in the browser or on the network (Man-in-the-middle) Source Destination Attacker Example 3: Falsiﬁcation ● Attacker forges new information ● Breaks authenticity, accountability and integrity ● Active attack ● Example: ○ Forging a signature through a crypto vulnerability (e.g. MD5 collisions) ○ Credential theft Source Destination Attacker Example 4: Interruption ● Attacker interrupts a service ● Breaks availability ● Active attack ● Examples: ○ DoS on E-Voting ○ DoS on power grid (e.g., Ukraine recent attacks) Source Destination Attacker More examples of disruptive attacks Incapacitation: physical destruction of or damage to system, possibly due to malware Corruption: modiﬁcation of system functions. E.g., placing backdoor in the system to provide subsequent access (breaks system integrity) Misappropriation: malicious software makes unauthorized use of processor and operating system resources.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
