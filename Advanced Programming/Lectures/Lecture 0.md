# Advanced Programming Languages (Fall 2024)
**Course Code:** CM 0632  
**Program:** MSc in Computer Science and Information Technology  
**University:** Ca’ Foscari University of Venice  

## Course Overview
This course dives into advanced concepts and techniques of modern programming languages, focusing on functional, object-oriented, and concurrent programming. It also introduces foundational tools from programming language theory and type-theoretic frameworks.

### Primary Language
- **Scala** (integrates modern techniques with principled design)

### Additional Languages
- Statically typed: ML, Haskell, Java, Rust  
- Dynamically typed: Python  

## Course Content
- **Introduction**
  - Evolution of programming language design and implementation
  - Introduction to functional programming in Scala
- **Typing Foundations**
  - Untyped Lambda Calculus and operational semantics
  - Types, type systems, and type safety
- **Functional Data and Function Modeling**
  - Immutable non-encapsulated data structures
  - Lists, trees, polymorphic, first-order, and higher-order functions
- **Typing and Subtyping**
  - Subtype polymorphism and substitution principle
  - Nominal vs structural typing
- **Object-Oriented Data Modeling**
  - Encapsulated data types using Scala’s traits and classes
  - Type parameterization: Generics, variance, type bounds
- **Polymorphism**
  - Ad hoc polymorphism
  - Constrained parametric polymorphism (e.g., F-bounded)
  - Qualified types and type classes
- **Evaluation Strategies**
  - Strict vs non-strict evaluation
  - Lazy evaluation: thunks, lazy lists, infinite data structures
- **Error Handling**
  - Exceptions, Options, and Try
  - Monads and monadic programming (State, IO)
