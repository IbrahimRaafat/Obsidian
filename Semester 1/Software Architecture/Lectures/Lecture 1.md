# Lecture 1: Introduction to Software Architectures

## Key Concepts

- **Software Architecture Definition**: Fundamental structures of software systems and the discipline of creating such structures.
  - High-level design decisions that are hard to change later.
  - Focus on modularity, scalability, performance, and configurability.

- **Concept vs. Technology**:
  - *Concept*: Abstract, applicable across contexts.
  - *Technology*: Practical application of concepts.
  - University focuses on teaching concepts; enterprises emphasize applying technologies.

- **Course Goals**:
  - Overview of historical and current software architectures.
  - Develop critical thinking about architectural choices.

## Course Structure

- **In-person Lectures**: Focus on concepts (~10 sessions).
- **Online Lectures**: Cover technologies (~12 sessions).
- **Practical Sessions**:
  - Group projects to implement architectures.
  - Topics include microservices, modularity, and performance.

## Key Topics and Tools

- **Architectural Patterns**:
  - Monolithic vs. Distributed.
  - Microservices, Event-driven, Layered.

- **Technologies**:
  - Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda.
  - Java, Spring, Gradle, Hibernate.
  - RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication.

- **Software Characteristics**:
  - Availability, scalability, performance, modularity.

## Project and Evaluation

- **Projects**:
  - 3 group tasks during the course.
  - Final project includes GitHub repo submission and documentation.

- **Exam**:
  - Written exam covering in-person lectures.
