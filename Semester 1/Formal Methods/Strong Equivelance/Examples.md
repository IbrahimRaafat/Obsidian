Certainly! Below are examples with detailed solutions for strong equivalence, formatted in Markdown for easy copying:

### Example 1: Simple Processes

#### Problem

Consider two processes P and Q defined as follows:

- P=(a,λ).P
    
- Q=(a,λ).Q
    

Determine if P and Q are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - P performs action a with rate λ and transitions back to P.
        
    - Q performs action a with rate λ and transitions back to Q.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(P,Q)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (P,Q)∈R:
        
        - P can perform action a and transition to P.
            
        - Q can perform action a and transition to Q.
            
        - Therefore, (P,Q)∈R holds.
            

Since P and Q can simulate each other's behavior step by step, they are strongly equivalent.

### Example 2: Processes with Different Rates

#### Problem

Consider two processes P and Q defined as follows:

- P=(a,λ).P
    
- Q=(a,μ).Q
    

Determine if P and Q are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - P performs action a with rate λ and transitions back to P.
        
    - Q performs action a with rate μ and transitions back to Q.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(P,Q)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (P,Q)∈R:
        
        - P can perform action a with rate λ and transition to P.
            
        - Q can perform action a with rate μ and transition to Q.
            
        - Since λ=μ, the rates of the actions are different.
            

Since the rates of the actions are different, P and Q cannot simulate each other's behavior step by step. Therefore, they are **not** strongly equivalent.

### Example 3: Processes with Different Actions

#### Problem

Consider two processes P and Q defined as follows:

- P=(a,λ).P
    
- Q=(b,λ).Q
    

Determine if P and Q are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - P performs action a with rate λ and transitions back to P.
        
    - Q performs action b with rate λ and transitions back to Q.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(P,Q)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (P,Q)∈R:
        
        - P can perform action a and transition to P.
            
        - Q can perform action b and transition to Q.
            
        - Since the actions a and b are different, P and Q cannot simulate each other's behavior step by step.
            

Since the actions are different, P and Q are **not** strongly equivalent.

### Example 4: Processes with Internal Actions

#### Problem

Consider two processes P and Q defined as follows:

- P=(a,λ).P
    
- Q=(a,λ).(τ,μ).Q
    

Determine if P and Q are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - P performs action a with rate λ and transitions back to P.
        
    - Q performs action a with rate λ and then performs an internal action τ with rate μ before transitioning back to Q.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(P,Q)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (P,Q)∈R:
        
        - P can perform action a and transition to P.
            
        - Q can perform action a and transition to an intermediate state before performing the internal action τ.
            
        - Since P does not have the internal action τ, P and Q cannot simulate each other's behavior step by step.
            

Since Q has an additional internal action τ, P and Q are **not** strongly equivalent.

### Example 5: Complex Processes

#### Problem

Consider two processes S0 and S′0 defined as follows:

- S0=(use,2ρ).S1+(use,3ρ).S2
    
    - S1=(reset,λ).S0
        
    - S2=(reset,λ).S0
        
- S′0=(use,5ρ).S′1
    
    - S′1=(reset,λ).S′0
        

Determine if S0 and S′0 are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - S0 can perform action use with rate 2ρ and transition to S1, or perform action use with rate 3ρ and transition to S2.
        
    - S1 and S2 both perform action reset with rate λ and transition back to S0.
        
    - S′0 can perform action use with rate 5ρ and transition to S′1.
        
    - S′1 performs action reset with rate λ and transitions back to S′0.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(S0,S′0),(S1,S′0),(S2,S′0)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (S0,S′0)∈R:
        
        - S0 can perform action use with rates 2ρ and 3ρ.
            
        - S′0 can perform action use with rate 5ρ.
            
        - The rates of the actions are different, and S0 has multiple transitions for the same action.
            

Since the rates of the actions are different and S0 has multiple transitions for the same action, S0 and S′0 cannot simulate each other's behavior step by step. Therefore, they are **not** strongly equivalent.

### Example 6: Processes with Multiple Actions

#### Problem

Consider two processes P and Q defined as follows:

- P=(a,λ).P+(b,μ).P
    
- Q=(a,λ).Q+(b,μ).Q
    

Determine if P and Q are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution

1. **Define the Processes**:
    
    - P can perform action a with rate λ or action b with rate μ and transition back to P.
        
    - Q can perform action a with rate λ or action b with rate μ and transition back to Q.
        
2. **Construct the Relation R**:
    
    - Let R={(P,Q)}.
        
3. **Verify the Relation**:
    
    - For (P,Q)∈R:
        
        - P can perform action a with rate λ and transition to P.
            
        - Q can perform action a with rate λ and transition to Q.
            
        - ( P



User: Can you show me complexexamples that end up strongly equivilant?
Kimi: Certainly! Below are complex examples where two processes are shown to be strongly equivalent. These examples involve multiple actions and transitions, and they demonstrate how to construct and verify a strong equivalence relation.

### Example 1: Complex Processes with Multiple Actions

#### Problem
Consider two processes \( P \) and \( Q \) defined as follows:
- \( P = (a, \lambda).P + (b, \mu).P \)
- \( Q = (a, \lambda).Q + (b, \mu).Q \)

Determine if \( P \) and \( Q \) are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution
1. **Define the Processes**:
   - \( P \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) or action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( P \).
   - \( Q \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) or action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( Q \).

2. **Construct the Relation \( R \)**:
   - Let \( R = \{ (P, Q) \} \).

3. **Verify the Relation**:
   - For \( (P, Q) \in R \):
     - \( P \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( P \).
     - \( Q \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( Q \).
     - \( P \) can perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( P \).
     - \( Q \) can perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( Q \).

Since \( P \) and \( Q \) can simulate each other's behavior step by step, they are strongly equivalent.

### Example 2: Processes with Sequential Actions

#### Problem
Consider two processes \( S0 \) and \( S'0 \) defined as follows:
- \( S0 = (use, \lambda).S1 \)
  - \( S1 = (reset, \mu).S0 \)
- \( S'0 = (use, \lambda).S'1 \)
  - \( S'1 = (reset, \mu).S'0 \)

Determine if \( S0 \) and \( S'0 \) are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution
1. **Define the Processes**:
   - \( S0 \) performs action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transitions to \( S1 \).
   - \( S1 \) performs action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transitions back to \( S0 \).
   - \( S'0 \) performs action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transitions to \( S'1 \).
   - \( S'1 \) performs action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transitions back to \( S'0 \).

2. **Construct the Relation \( R \)**:
   - Let \( R = \{ (S0, S'0), (S1, S'1) \} \).

3. **Verify the Relation**:
   - For \( (S0, S'0) \in R \):
     - \( S0 \) can perform action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( S1 \).
     - \( S'0 \) can perform action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( S'1 \).
   - For \( (S1, S'1) \in R \):
     - \( S1 \) can perform action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( S0 \).
     - \( S'1 \) can perform action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( S'0 \).

Since \( S0 \) and \( S'0 \) can simulate each other's behavior step by step, and \( S1 \) and \( S'1 \) can also simulate each other's behavior, \( S0 \) and \( S'0 \) are strongly equivalent.

### Example 3: Processes with Multiple States and Actions

#### Problem
Consider two processes \( P \) and \( Q \) defined as follows:
- \( P = (a, \lambda).P1 + (b, \mu).P2 \)
  - \( P1 = (c, \nu).P \)
  - \( P2 = (d, \xi).P \)
- \( Q = (a, \lambda).Q1 + (b, \mu).Q2 \)
  - \( Q1 = (c, \nu).Q \)
  - \( Q2 = (d, \xi).Q \)

Determine if \( P \) and \( Q \) are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution
1. **Define the Processes**:
   - \( P \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( P1 \), or perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( P2 \).
   - \( P1 \) performs action \( c \) with rate \( \nu \) and transitions back to \( P \).
   - \( P2 \) performs action \( d \) with rate \( \xi \) and transitions back to \( P \).
   - \( Q \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( Q1 \), or perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( Q2 \).

2. **Construct the Relation \( R \)**:
   - Let \( R = \{ (P, Q), (P1, Q1), (P2, Q2) \} \).

3. **Verify the Relation**:
   - For \( (P, Q) \in R \):
     - \( P \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( P1 \).
     - \( Q \) can perform action \( a \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( Q1 \).
     - \( P \) can perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( P2 \).
     - \( Q \) can perform action \( b \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition to \( Q2 \).
   - For \( (P1, Q1) \in R \):
     - \( P1 \) can perform action \( c \) with rate \( \nu \) and transition back to \( P \).
     - \( Q1 \) can perform action \( c \) with rate \( \nu \) and transition back to \( Q \).
   - For \( (P2, Q2) \in R \):
     - \( P2 \) can perform action \( d \) with rate \( \xi \) and transition back to \( P \).
     - \( Q2 \) can perform action \( d \) with rate \( \xi \) and transition back to \( Q \).

Since \( P \) and \( Q \) can simulate each other's behavior step by step, and the same holds for \( P1 \) and \( Q1 \), as well as \( P2 \) and \( Q2 \), \( P \) and \( Q \) are strongly equivalent.

Determine if \( S0 \) and \( S'0 \) are strongly equivalent.

#### Solution
1. **Define the Processes**:
   - \( S0 \) can perform action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( S1 \), or perform action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( S0 \).
   - \( S1 \) performs action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transitions back to \( S0 \).
   - \( S'0 \) can perform action \( use \) with rate \( \lambda \) and transition to \( S'1 \), or perform action \( reset \) with rate \( \mu \) and transition back to \( S'0 \).
