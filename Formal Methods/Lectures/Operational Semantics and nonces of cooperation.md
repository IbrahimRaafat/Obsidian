### Understanding PEPA's Operational Semantics and Cooperation

---

#### **1. Plotkin-Style Structured Operational Rules**

- **Plotkin-Style Rules**:
  - These rules use a "small-step semantics" approach, breaking the system behavior into incremental steps.
  - Time isn't explicitly represented; it's assumed each activity requires some time.

- **Inference Rules**:
  - The operational rules are read as:
    - "If the transitions above the line hold, then the transition below the line can be inferred."

---

#### **2. Prefix, Constant, Choice, and Hiding Rules**

##### **Prefix Rule**:
For a prefix activity:
```math
(\alpha, r).P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P
```
- The process can transition to \( P \) by performing action \( \alpha \) at rate \( r \).

---

##### **Constant Rule**:
For a constant definition \( A \overset{\text{def}}{=} P \):
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \quad \Rightarrow \quad A \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P'
```
- The constant behaves as its definition.

---

##### **Choice Rule**:
For two components \( P \) and \( Q \) with a choice:
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P + Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P'
```
```math
Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} Q' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P + Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} Q'
```
- Either \( P \) or \( Q \) can proceed, depending on which can perform action \( \alpha \).

---

##### **Hiding Rule**:
For a hiding operator:
1. If \( \alpha \notin L \):
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P / L \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' / L
```
2. If \( \alpha \in L \):
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P / L \xrightarrow{\tau, r} P' / L
```
   - Actions in \( L \) are hidden (converted to \( \tau \)).

---

#### **3. Cooperation Rules**

##### **Cooperation (Action \( \alpha \notin L \))**:
If action \( \alpha \) isn't in the cooperation set \( L \), both components act independently:
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \bowtie_L Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \bowtie_L Q
```
```math
Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} Q' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \bowtie_L Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P \bowtie_L Q'
```

---

##### **Cooperation (Action \( \alpha \in L \))**:
When \( \alpha \in L \), \( P \) and \( Q \) must synchronize:
```math
P \xrightarrow{\alpha, r_1} P' \quad Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r_2} Q' \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \bowtie_L Q \xrightarrow{\alpha, r} P' \bowtie_L Q'
```
Where:
```math
r = \min(r_\alpha(P), r_\alpha(Q))
```
- The rate is the slower of the two apparent rates, as both components need to cooperate.

---

#### **4. Cooperation and Shared Activities**

- **Shared Action Rate**:
  - The apparent rate of a shared action \( \alpha \) is determined by the slower of the two apparent rates from \( P \) and \( Q \).
  
- **Bounded Capacity**:
  - PEPA assumes components cannot be forced to operate faster by cooperation; hence, the cooperation rate is limited by the slower participant.

- **Example**:
  - \( P \) and \( Q \) cooperate with respective rates \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \):
    ```math
    \text{Probability of } \alpha = \frac{r_1}{r_\alpha(P)} \cdot \frac{r_2}{r_\alpha(Q)}
    ```

---

#### **5. Multi-Way Cooperation**

- PEPA supports multi-way cooperation, where three or more components synchronize on shared actions.
- Example:
```math
((\alpha, r).P \bowtie_\alpha (\alpha, s).Q) \bowtie_\alpha (\alpha, t).R
```
  - All three components \( P, Q, R \) must synchronize on \( \alpha \).

##### **Behavioral Variations**:
1. **Example 1**:
   - \( P \) and \( Q \) compete to synchronize with \( R \), creating contention for \( \alpha \).

2. **Example 2**:
   - \( P \) and \( Q \) synchronize first, while \( R \) performs \( \alpha \) independently.
